    <p><b>Prematurity: Early and Late Complications</b></p>
    <p>Preterm infants are at risk for developing early and late complications that result from anatomic or functional immaturity during the neonatal period. The risk of developing complications increases with decreasing gestational age and birth weight. </p>
    <p style="margin-left:3em;"><b>Initial stabilization and procedures:</b> Intubation and surfactant administration, umbilical lines for fluids and medications (later PICC lines for medications and TPN delivery), total peripheral nutrition, nasogastric tube for gavage feeds, multiple courses of antibiotics, phototherapy for hyperbilirubin etc.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:3em;"><b>Hypothermia:</b>  Rapid heat loss occurs in preterm infants because of their relatively large body surface area and inability to produce enough heat. Heat is lost by conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation</p>
    <b style="margin-left:3em;">Respiratory complications:</b>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)</b> is caused by surfactant deficiency.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Air leak and pneumothorax</b> can occur secondary to RDS and positive pressure ventilation.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)</b> also known as chronic lung disease, is a late respiratory complication that commonly occurs in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Apnea of prematurity</b> occurs in approximately 25 percent of preterm infants. </p>
    <b style="margin-left:3em;">Cardiovascular complications:</b>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b> •	Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA):</b>Symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is common in preterm neonates, occurring in about 30 percent of VLBW infants.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Systemic hypotension</b></p>
    <b style="margin-left:3em;">Neurological complications:</b>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Intraventricular hemorrhage:</b> Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) usually occurs in the fragile germinal matrix and increases in frequency with decreasing BW. The incidence of severe IVH (Grades III and IV) is about 12 to 15 percent in VLBW infants.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus:</b> Also referred to as progressive ventricular dilatation, occurs in approximately 25 percent of infants with IVH, most commonly following grade III/IVH or periventricular hemorrhagic infarction.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Periventricular leukomalacia:</b> PVL is the major form of cerebral brain white matter injury that affects premature infants, and is associated with the subsequent development of cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment, and visual disturbances.</p>
    <b style="margin-left:3em;">Gastrointestinal complications:</b>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Necrotizing enterocolitis:</b> NEC occurs in 2 to 10 percent of VLBW infants and is associated with an increase in mortality. Survivors are at increased risk for growth delay and neurodevelopmental disabilities.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:5em;"><b>•	Spontaneous Intestinal perforation:</b> Also referred to as isolated perforation of the newborn, is a single intestinal perforation that is typically found at the terminal ileum. SIP occurs primarily in premature infants with very low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight < 1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW, birth weight < 1000 g). The median age at perforation is seven days with a range of 0 to 15 days.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:3em;"><b>Infection:</b> Premature infant are at increased risk of early onset sepsis (acquired from mother) and hospital acquired infection. E.g. CLABSI – Central line associated blood stream infection which is a complication of PICC line placement. They get treated with antibiotics during their hospital stay.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:3em;"><b>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP):</b> It is a developmental vascular proliferative disorder that occurs in the incompletely vascularized retina of preterm infants. </p>
